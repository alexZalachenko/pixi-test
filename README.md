Small project for a code assignment.
The project is based on a Creation Template from PixiJS Create.
The project features a Main Screen from where the user can navigate to all three demos and back to Main Screen.
The cards demo logic is split between view logic (CardsScreen) and game logic (CardsGame). For the other demos there's only a view logic since they were simpler.
Some of the configuration lives in a configuration file. Ideally all configuration variables should be there but due to time constrains I haven't been able to.
